# Object Mapping Hackathon

Welcome to the Visiosoft Object Mapping Hackathon!
- The purpose of our hackathon is to object mapping that detected objects by artificial intelligence from different points on the map.
- In our dataset, there are boundary boxes, IDs of objects taken with 3 different devices from several points and location (latitude, longitude) information where the photos were acquired.
- We ask you to use the locations of the photos to calculate the location of the objects detected from two or more points on the map using numerical methods.
- Here you will see how to use the dataset with an example script and learn about our dataset.
